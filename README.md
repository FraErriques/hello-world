# hello-world
training repository
With this repository I intend to practice about #some changes here# branches and pull requests and all the other stuff, necessary to use Git.
My target is to have a cloud repository for my main projects, so that I can fetch them and work on them from anywhere; and send the pull requests that I will manage.
My coding is mainly about Numerical Analysis.
I'm not yet ready to use Git; in the meanwhile I will practice with this Hallo World repository.
