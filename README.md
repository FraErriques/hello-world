# hello-world
training repository
With this repository I intend to practice about branches and pull requests and all the other stuff, necessary to use Git.
My target is to have a cloud repository for my main projects, so that I can fetch them and work on them from anywhere; and send the pull requests that I will manage.
My coding is mainly about Numerical Analysis.
I'm not yet ready to use Git; in the meanwhile I will practice with this Hallo World repository.
I have learned something about 'git clone' and 'git push'. Want to learn now, about 'fetch' & 'merge'.

Gonna try now the merge command.
On Monday 23#07#2018 I added a branch called "namedBranch" on the remote and then fetched it on the local (i.e. git fetch origin namedBranch)
then swithced to it, on the fileSystem (i.e. git checkout namedBranch ). Next step: I'll try a non fast-forward merge.
